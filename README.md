# Prediction-Market-for-Macro-Economic-Variable-

Data analysis and prediction project for the banking sector, focusing on customer behavior and its relation to various economic variables, with a particular emphasis on the unemployment rate. The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Data is gathered from various banking sector websites. This data includes macroeconomic variables like interest rate, deposit rate, GDP, yield, and the targeted variable, which is the unemployment rate.

2. Data Cleaning and Database Creation: The raw data is refined and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or errors. Then, a database is created to store the collected and cleaned data.

3. Data Analysis: The collected data is analyzed to understand the relationships and correlations between the unemployment rate and other macroeconomic variables like interest rate, deposit rate, GDP, and yield.

4. Machine Learning Models: Regression models such as Linear Regression, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average eXogenous factors (SARIMAX), ADA Boost Regression model, and Random Forest Regression model are used for future predictions. These models help in estimating and analyzing customer behavior based on the targeted variable (unemployment rate) in conjunction with other economic factors.

5. Prediction and Analysis: The machine learning models are applied to predict future development rates for the banking sector, focusing on profit and loss. By using data related to deposits, cash, and income rate of the bank, the unemployment rate can be estimated, which can further inform business decisions and help ensure profits.

6. Implementation: The predictions generated by the models can be used by the banking sector to make informed decisions regarding their business strategies and to mitigate potential risks associated with changes in the unemployment rate and other economic variables.

Overall, this project aims to provide valuable insights into customer behavior and its relationship with the unemployment rate, as well as to enable the banking sector to optimize their profits and minimize losses by leveraging data-driven predictions.
